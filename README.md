## Audio Processing with Librosa

# Overview

This repository focuses on audio processing using the Librosa library, providing a comprehensive guide on how to process audio files and extract essential features for machine learning applications. Librosa is a powerful Python library for analyzing audio and music, making it an excellent tool for audio feature extraction and visualization.

# Features Extraction

1. Amplitude Envelope: Represents the amplitude variations over time.

2. Zero Crossing Rate: Measures the rate at which the audio signal changes its sign.

3. Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE): Represents the energy of the audio signal.

4. Spectrogram: A visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound signal as they vary with time.

5. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC): A representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound signal.

# Usage

1. Load an audio file using Librosa.
2. Extract time domain features: Amplitude Envelope, Zero Crossing Rate, and Root Mean Square Energy.
3. Apply Fourier Transform to generate a Spectrogram and compute Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).
4. Visualize the extracted features for a deeper understanding of the audio signal.
